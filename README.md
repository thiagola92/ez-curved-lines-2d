# Scalable Vector Shapes 2D plugin for Godot 4.4

Scalable Vector Shapes 2D lets you do 3 things:
1. Draw seamless vector shapes using a Path Editor inspired by the awesome [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) with a new node type: [`ScalableVectorShape2D`](./addons/curved_lines_2d/scalable_vector_shape_2d.gd)[^1]
2. Animate the shape of the curve using keyframes on a [property-track](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/animation/introduction.html#doc-introduction-animation)  in an [`AnimationPlayer`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_animationplayer.html#class-animationplayer)
3. Import [.svg](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/) files as seamless vector shapes in stead of as raster images[^2]

[^2]: __Important sidenote__: _This plugin only supports a small - yet relevant - subset of the huge [SVG Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html)_

## Watch the A-Z explainer on Youtube

In this 10 minute video I explain how to use all the features of Scalable Vector Shapes 2D in short succession:

[![link to the explainer](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/a-z-explainer-youtube-thumbnail.png)](https://youtu.be/_QOnMRrlIMk?feature=shared)

[^1]: Looking for EZ Curved Lines 2D? The renamed plugin deprecates the old [`DrawablePath2D`](./addons/curved_lines_2d/drawable_path_2d.gd) custom node in favor of `ScalableVectorShape2D`. A Conversion button is provided: [converter button](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/00-converter.png). The reason is that [`ScalableVectorShape2D`](./addons/curved_lines_2d/scalable_vector_shape_2d.gd) inherits directly from `Node2D` giving much more control to the plugin over how you can draw.

# Drawing Shapes in the Godot 2D Viewport

## Basic Drawing Explainer on youtube

[![Explainer basic drawing on youtube](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/basic-drawing-youtube-thumnail.png)](https://youtu.be/_QOnMRrlIMk?t=126&feature=shared)

After activating this plugin a new bottom panel item appears, called "Scalable Vector Graphics".

There are 2 recommended ways to start drawing:
1. [Creating a Circle/Ellipse, Rectangle or empty Path using the bottom panel item](#generating-a-circle-ellipse-or-rectangle-using-the-bottom-panel-item)
2. [Using the `.svg` importer](#using-the-svg-importer)


# Generating a Circle, Ellipse or Rectangle using the bottom panel item


The  `Scalable Vector Shapes` bottom panel gives you some basic choices:

![the bottom panel](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/06-scalable-vector-shapes-panel.png)

## Creating Paths based on Bézier curves

Pressing the `Create Empty Path` or one of the `Create Path` buttons will add a new shape to an open `2D Scene` in 'Path' mode, meaning all points in the 'Bézier' curve are editable.

![create ellipse as path](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/create-ellipse-as-path.png)


## Creating 'primitive' scapes: Rectangle and Ellipse

It's probably easier to start out with a basic primitive shape (like you would in Inkscape <3) using the `Create Rectangle` or `Create Ellipse` button. This will expose less features, but will make it a lot easier to manipulate shapes:

![create rect as rect](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/create-rect-as-rect.png)

Ellipses will only have one handle to change the `size` property with (representing the x and y diameter). This will set the `rx` and `ry` property indirectly.

Rectangles will have a handle for `size` and 2 handles for rounded corners `rx` and `ry` property.

# Using the `.svg` importer


[![watch explainer on youtube](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/importing-svg-files-youtube-thumbnail.png)](https://youtu.be/3j_OEfU8qbo?feature=shared)


As mentioned in the introduction, the `.svg` import supports a small - _yet relevant_ - subset of the [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/).

That being said, it's still pretty cool and serves my purposes quite well. You can drag any `.svg` resource file into the first tab of the bottom dock to see if it works for you too:

![svg importer dock](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/13-svg-importer-dock.png)

On the left side of this panel is a form with a couple of options you can experiment with. On the right side is an import log, which will show warnings of known problems, usually unsupported stuff:

![svg importer log](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/14-import-warnings.png)

As the link in the log suggest, you can report [issues](https://github.com/Teaching-myself-Godot/ez-curved-lines-2d/issues) on github; be sure to check if something is already listed.

Don't let that stop you, though, your future infinite zoomer and key-frame animator will love you for it.

# Manipulating shapes

The hints in the 2D viewport should have you covered, but this section lists all the operations available to you. You can also watch the chapter on sculpting paths on youtube:

[![sculpting paths on youtube](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/sculpting-paths-on-youtube.png)](https://youtu.be/_QOnMRrlIMk?t=295&feature=shared)


## Adding a point to a shape

Using `Ctrl` + `Left Click` you can add a point anywhere in the 2D viewport, while your shape is selected.

By double clicking on a line segment you can add a point _inbetween_ 2 existing points:

![add point to a line](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/18-add-point-to-line.png)

## Bending a curve

Holding the mouse over line segment you can start dragging it to turn it into a curve.

![bend line](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/05-bend.png)

## Creating, mirroring and dragging control point handles

When you have new node you can drag out curve manipulation control points while holding the `Shift` button. The 2 control points will be mirrored for a symmetrical / round effect.

Dragging control point handles while holding `Shift` will keep them mirrored / round:

![mirrored handle manipulation](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/07-mirrored-handles.png)

Dragging them without holding shift will allow for unmirrored / shap corners:

![shar corner](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/08-sharp.png)

## Closing the loop and breaking the loop

Double clicking on the start node, or end node of an unclosed shape will close the loop.

Double clicking on the start-/endpoint again will break the loop back up:

![closed loop](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/09-loop.png)

You can recognise the start-/endpoint(s) by the infinity symbol: ∞

## Deleting points and control points

You can delete points and control points by using right click.


## Setting the pivot of your shape

You can use the `Change pivot` mode to change the origin of your shape, just like you would a `Sprite2D`. In this case, the 'pivot' will actually be the `position` property of you `ScalableVectorShape2D` node.

This rat will want to rotate it's head elsewhere:

![set origin](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/16-set-origin.png)

Like this:

![set origin 2](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/16a-set_origin.png)

# Manipulating gradients

Once a gradient is assigned to the 'Fill' of your shape via the inspector, its properties can be changed using the same controls as will the other handles.

## Changing the start- and endpoint of the gradient

Drag the outer orbit of the start- and endpoint of a the gradient line using the left mouse button to move them:

![drag gradient start- and end-position](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/drag_gradient_start.png)


## Changing the color stop positions

Drag the color stops along the gradient line to change their position.

Right click to remove a color stop.

![changing color stops](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/drag_remove_color_stops.png)

## Add new color stops

Double clicking on the gradient line will add a new color stop (the assigned color will be sampled from the existing color at that point)

![adding a color stop](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/add_color_stop.png)

# The Project Settings in the Scalable Vector Shapes panel

A couple of settings in the bottom panel are stored across sessions to represent your preferences:
- Editor settings (how the 2D Viewport should behave):
  - Enable/Disable ScalableVectorShape2D Editing (when checked off, you can edit nodes the normal, built-in, godot-way. You _are_ going to need this)
  - Show/Hide Edit hints
  - Show Point Numbers (which are the exact _indices_ of each point on the `Curve2D` of this shape)
- Draw Settings:
  - Stroke Width
  - Enable/Disable Fill (when creating new shapes via the bottom panel)
  - Fill color (when creating new shapes in the bottom panel)
  - Enable/Disable Stroke (when creating new shapes via the bottom panel)
  - Stroke color (when creating new shapes in the bottom panel)
  - Enable/Disable Collisions (when creating new shapes via the bottom panel)
- Paint order: a toggle which represent what comes in front of what (when creating new shapes in the bottom panel)


# Using the Inspector Form for `ScalableVectorShape2D`

The following custom forms were added, with extensive tooltips to help explain the actual functions they provide:

- [Fill](#the-fill-inspector-form) (actually the assigned `Polygon2D`)
- [Stroke](#the-stroke-inspector-form) (actually the assigned `Line2D`)
- [Collision Polygon](#the-collision-polygon-inspector-form) (just a button to generate a new `CollisionPolygon2D`)
- [Curve Settings](#the-curve-settings-inspector-form)
- [Shape Type Settings](#the-shape-type-inspector-form)
- [Editor Settings](#the-editor-settings-inspector-form)

When a primitive shape (basic rectangle or ellipse) is selected, a `Convert to Path` button is also provided up top.

![screenshot of the inspector](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/inspector-in-2.5.png)

## The Fill inspector form

When the selected shape has no fill, an `Add Fill` button is provided. Clicking that will create and assign a new `Polygon2D` to the selected `ScalableVectorShape2D`:

![screenshot of fill form without fill](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/fill-form-no-fill.png)

Once assigned, the following options are available:
- Fill color, changes the `color` property of the assigned `Polygon2D`
- Gradient, will assign or remove a `GradientTexture2D` to the `Polygon2D`
- Stop colors (if a gradient is set), one color button per color
- A `Edit Polygon2D` button, which will make the editor select the assigned `Polygon2D`

Below that, a standard godot `Assign ...`-field is also available to set the `polygon`-property directly with and to enable unassignment.

## The Stroke inspector form

When the selected shape has no stroke, an `Add Stroke` button is provided. Clicking that will create and assign a new `Line2D` to the selected `ScalableVectorShape2D`:

![screenshot of stroke form without stroke](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/stroke-form-no-stroke.png)

Once assigned, the following options are available:
- Stroke color, changes the `default_color` property of the assigned `Line2D`
- Stroke width, changing the `width` property of the assigned `Line2D`

Below that, a standard godot `Assign ...`-field is also available to set the `line`-property directly with and to enable unassignment.

## The Collision Polygon inspector form

This works the same as the Fill- and Stroke forms, but in this case a `CollisionPolygon2D` is assigned to the `collision_polygon`-property.

## The Curve settings inspector form

The curve settings inspector form provides the following options
- A `Batch insert` keyframes button for all the `Curve2D`'s control points (the whole shape). This will be active when a valid track is being edited in a `AnimationPlayer` via the bottom panel
- The standard godot built-in editor for `Curve2D` resources, assigned to the `curve` property of the selected `ScalableVectorShape2D`
- The `update_curve_at_runtime` checkbox, which enables animating the entire shape
- The `max_stages` property which influences smoothness (and performance!) of curve drawing; a higher value means smoother lines
- The `tolerance_degrees` property, which also influences smoothness (and performance) of curve drawing: a lower value adds a smoother curve, especially for very subtle bends

## The Shape type inspector form

This form allows manipulation of the properties of primitive shape types (rectangle, ellipsis):
- Shape type, here you can selected the type of the shape: Path, Rect and Ellipse. (Be warned: changing a shape from a path to a primitive shape is a destructive action and cannot be undone)
- Offset: this represents the position of the pivot relative to the shape's natural center.
- Size: the box size of the entire shape (stroke thickness excluded)
- Rx: the x-radius of the shape
- Ry: the y-radius of the shape

It is best to change these properties via the handles in the 2D editor. They are, however, quite useful for animating key frames.


## The Editor settings inspector form

This form exposes 2 settings:

- Shape Hint Color: the color of the line with which this shape is drawn, when selected
- Lock Assigned Shapes: when this is checked, added strokes, fills and collision polygons will be locked in the editor, once created.



# More about assigned `Line2D`, `Polygon2D` and `CollisionPolygon2D`

Using the `Add ...` buttons in the inspector simply adds a new node as a child to `ScalableVectorShape2D` but it does __not need to be__ a child. The important bit is that the new node is _assigned_ to it via its properties: `polygon`, `line` and `collision_polygon`:

## The assigned shapes are now siblings

![assigned tree](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/12a-assigned.png)

## Yet they still respond to changes to your `ScalableVectorShape2D`

![assigned viewport](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/12b-assigned.png)

## Because you assigned them to it using the inspector

![assigned inspector](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/12c-assigned.png)

## Watch the chapter about working with collisions, paint order and the node hierarchy on youtube

This video gives more context on how `Line2D`, `Polygon2D` and `CollisionPolygon2D` are _assigned_ to the `ScalableVectorShape2D`:

[![working with collisions, paint order and the node hierarchy on youtube](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/more-on-node-hierarchy.png)](https://youtu.be/_QOnMRrlIMk?t=371&feature=shared)


# Animating / Changing shapes at runtime

## Youtube explainer on animating

Watch this explainer on youtube on animating:

[![link to Youtube explainer about animating](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/animating-youtube-thumbnail.png)](https://youtu.be/IwS2Rf65i18?feature=shared)

## A note up front (this being said)

The shapes you create will work fine with basic key-frame operations.

You can even detach the Line2D, Polygon2D and CollisionPolygon2D from `ScalableVectorShape2D` entirely, once you're done drawing and aligning, and change the `ScalableVectorShape2D` to a simple `Node2D` if necessary.

## Animating the shape and gradients at Runtime

Sometimes, however, you want your shape to change at runtime (or even your collision shape!)

You can use the `Update Curve at Runtime` checkbox in the inspector to enable dynamic changing of your curved shapes at runtime.

![update curve at runtime](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/update-curve-at-runtime-in-2.4.0.png)

## Add keyframes in an animation player

You can then add an `AnimationPlayer` node to your scene, create a new animation and (batch) insert key frames for the following this:
- The entire shape of your `ScalableVectorShape2D`, which are:
  - `curve:point_*/position`
  - `curve:point_*/in`
  - `curve:point_*/out`
- All the gradient properties of your fill (`Polygon2D` assigned to `ScalableVectorShape2D`), which are:
  - `texture:gradient:colors` (the entire `PackedColorArray`)
  - `texture:gradient:offsets` (the entire `PackedFloat32Array`)
  - `texture:fill_from`
  - `texture:fill_to`
- Stroke width, i.e.: the `width` property of the assigned `Line2D`
- Stroke color, i.e.: the `default_color`  of the assigned `Line2D`
- Fill color, i.e.: the `color` of the assigned `Polygon2D`

![the new key frame buttons in the inspector](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/animating-in-2.4.0.png)


## Don't duplicate `ScalableVectorShape2D`, use the `path_changed` signal in stead

When the `update_curve_at_runtime` property is checked, every time the curve changes in your game the `path_changed` signal is emitted.

Duplicating a `ScalableVectorShape2D` will __not__ make a new `Curve2D`, but use a reference. This means line-segments will be calculated multiple times on one and the same curve! Very wasteful.

If however you want to, for instance, animate 100 blades of grass, just use __one__ `DrawableShape2D` and have the 100 `Line2D` node listen to the `path_changed` signal and overwrite their `points` property with the `PackedVector2Array` argument of your listener `func`:

![path_changed signal](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/10-path_changed-signal.png)

This very short section of the youtube video illustrates how to do this: https://youtu.be/IwS2Rf65i18?feature=shared&t=55


## Performance impact

Animating curve points at runtime does, however, impact performance of your game, because calculating segments is an expensive operation.

Under `Tesselation settings` you can lower `Max Stages` or bump up `Tolerance Degrees` to reduce curve smoothness and increase performance (and vice-versa)
